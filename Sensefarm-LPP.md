Sensefarms CUBE 02 series 

UPLINK messages ( Sensor -> LoraServer -> Application ) described below.

DOWNLINK message format ( Application->LoraServer->Decvice), scroll down.

_Please note that the uplink and downlink formats differs considerable, due to customer request at different times_

# Uplink format from device to servers
The message format is a proprietary dynamic payload format. It was not originally intended to be published, but due to customer responses we have decided to do so.
The dynamic format allows us to customize the number of sensors for every specific order, and not all possible sensor combinations is transmitted all the time. Sensor data can suddenly start to be included in the messages, or removed, if a sensor is considered broken by the device itself.

## Payload

Every sensor has 1 header byte and atleast 1 byte for value.

| Header  | Value      | Header | Value | ... |
| :-----: | :--------: | :--------: | :--------: | :--------: |
| 1 Byte  | 1..N Bytes | 1 Byte | 1..N Bytes | ... |


### Header byte
Sensor header contains the type of sensor and a number to diffrentiate it from other sensors of the same type. This means each device can have a maximum of 8 sensors of the same type, usually temperature sensors inside and outside the device box.

| Bit 7..3 | Bit 2..0   |
| :------: | :--------: |
| Type     | ID 0..7    |


### Sensor Type (Uplink)
All multi-byte values are Big-endian.

# Downlink format from servers to device
For the CUBE02 series we adopted parts of the Elsys format ( see https://www.elsys.se/en/wp-content/uploads/sites/3/2016/09/ELSYS_downlink_payload_v2-1.pdf ) and it differs considerable from the downlink protocol. 
Elsys has an online message generator
https://www.elsys.se/en/downlink-generator/ ( Be careful of putting in the correct numbers without spaces as it does not check for errors. The reboot command needs a number even though that command does not use parameters. )

There must be a headerbyte of 0x3E first.

Then follows a byte with number of bytes following that byte. 

Supported commands are:

| Hex  | Name               | Size | Format              | Comment                   |
| :---:| :---:              |:---: | :---:               | :---:                     |
| 0x1F | Send Period        | 4    | Unsigned            | Seconds to sleep until next measurement |
| 0xFE | Reboot             | 0    | -                   | Reboot the device. This forced the device to use new settings. Reboot command should always be last in the command list as it does an immeditate reboot when read. |

_Do not send unsupported Elsys commands. They might work but has not been tested fully and will void your warranty and might brick your device. Examples are AppSKey, NwkSKey and DevAddr. Contact Sensefarm if needed for additional support._

Example message:
```
3E061F00000E10FE 

0x3E = Header byte
0x06 = 6 bytes will follow
0x1F = Send period
0x00000E10 = 3600 seconds to sleep
0xFE = Reboot with new settings.

```
