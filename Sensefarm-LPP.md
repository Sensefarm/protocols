## Payload
Allows for any number of sensors and combinations.

| Sensor | Sensor | Sensor |  ...  |
| :----: | :----: | :----: | :---: |


### Sensor 
Every sensor has 1 header byte and atleast 1 byte for value.

| Header  | Value      |
| :-----: | :--------: |
| 1 Byte  | 1..N Bytes |


### Sensor Header
Sensor header contains the type of sensor and a number to diffrentiate it from other sensors of the same type. This means each device can have a maximum of 8 sensors of the same type.

| Bit 7..3 | Bit 2..0   |
| :------: | :--------: |
| Type     | ID 0..7    |


### Sensor Type (Uplink)
All multi-byte values are Big-endian.

### Actuator Type (Downlink)
The cube series adopted parts of the Elsys format. 
Elsys has an online message generator

There must be a headerbyte of 0x3E first.

Then follows a byte with number of bytes following that byte. 

Supported commands are:

| Hex  | Name               | Size | Format              | Comment                   |
| :---:| :---:              |:---: | :---:               | :---:                     |
| 0x1F | Send Period        | 4    | Unsigned            | Seconds to sleep until next measurement |
| 0xFE | Reboot             | 0    | -                   | Reboot the device. This forced the device to use new settings. Reboot command should always be last in the command list as it does an immeditate reboot when read. |

Example message:
```
3E061F00000E10FE 

0x3E = Header byte
0x06 = 6 bytes will follow
0x1F = Send period
0x00000E10 = 3600 seconds to sleep
0xFE = Reboot with new settings.

```
